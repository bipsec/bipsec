<h1>Hi there, I'm Biplab Kumar Sarkar 👋</h1>

## :man_office_worker: About me

I am working as a Sytem Engineer at Ariake Co. Ltd., Kumamoto, Japan. I worked as a Software Engineer in Bangladesh  for more than one year of experience in building web applications using Python, ReactJS, HTML, CSS, MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc. One of my favorite pastimes is tackling complex problems on online judge platforms. I find joy in analyzing problem statements, designing efficient algorithms, and crafting elegant code solutions. 

## 🧠 Larning
I'm currently learning Machine Learning to improve my skills and stay up-to-date with the latest technologies. I believe that continuous learning is the key to becoming a successful person in this modern era.
